:::

Welcome to this demonstration project showcasing essential market risk management techniques used in institutional portfolio analysis. This site combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation, mirroring tools a risk manager might use daily to monitor exposure, calculate capital requirements, and comply with financial regulations.

- **Interactive Risk Simulator**: Build custom portfolios with S&P 500 constituents, analyze historical returns, and compute live VaR/ES metrics using Shiny
- **Methodology Deep Dives**: Comparison of historical simulation vs parametric approaches 
- **Distribution Analysis**: Visual assessment of non-normal return patterns and tail risks

The code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EinMaulwurf/risk). Feedback is welcome!
