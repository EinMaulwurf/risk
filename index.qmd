*Quantifying Portfolio Risks in Banking Practice*

:::{.callout-warning}
## Work in progress
This site is not yet completed and may contain bugs and wrong information.
:::

Welcome to this demonstration project showcasing essential market risk management techniques used in institutional portfolio analysis. This site combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation, mirroring tools a risk manager might use daily to monitor exposure, calculate capital requirements, model volatility, and comply with financial regulations.

- **Interactive Risk Simulator**: Build custom portfolios with S&P 500 constituents, analyze historical returns, and compute live VaR/ES metrics using Shiny.
- **Methodology Deep Dives**: Comparison of historical simulation vs parametric approaches for VaR/ES.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Visual assessment of non-normal return patterns and tail risks.
- **Volatility Modelling**: Exploration of time-varying volatility using models like GARCH, including simulation and forecasting.

The code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EinMaulwurf/risk). Feedback is welcome!

**TODOs / Planned future enhancements:**

- [ ] Go more in-depth on how to calculate the covariance matrix of the returns and the mean and variance of the portfolio using linear algebra (for example $\sigma^2 = \mathbf{w}' \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}$).
- [x] Use eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the returns matrix for monte carlo simulation, see [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/resources/mit18_s096f13_lecnote7/).
- [x] Model VaR over more than one time period. For that, volatility clustering should be taken into account with models like (G)ARCH.
- [x] Use different parametric models besides the normal distribution. Perhaps the t-distribution for fat tails.
- [ ] Build portfolio with other assets besides stocks, like bonds, FX or derivatives.
- [ ] Clean up and align notation (for example, I sometimes use $\alpha=1\%$ and $\alpha=99\%$ to mean the same for the confidence level of VaR).
- [ ] Write more about pros and cons of arithmetic returns vs log returns.
- [ ] Show how rolling VaR (1, 3, 5 year) changes over time.
- [x] Build a simulation for GARCH and then estimate the parameters.
