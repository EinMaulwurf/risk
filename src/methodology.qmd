This document outlines different approaches to calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), which are key metrics in market risk management. They help us understand and quantify the potential losses on an investment or portfolio.

# Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall Approaches

There are three primary methods for calculating these market risk metrics:

## Historical Simulation

Imagine you have a record of the daily returns (percentage gains or losses) of an investment over the past few years. Historical simulation uses this past data directly to estimate future risk. It's like saying, "If the future looks like the past, what's the worst that could reasonably happen?"

**Key Idea:** We use the actual historical returns, without assuming any specific mathematical formula for how those returns are distributed. This is called a "non-parametric" approach.

**Value at Risk (VaR):**

The VaR at a confidence level $\alpha$ (e.g., 95% or 99%) tells you the maximum loss you'd expect to see *with that level of confidence*. More precisely, it's the loss that you would expect to exceed only $(1-\alpha)$% of the time.

To calculate it, we find the $\alpha$-quantile of the historical returns. Think of sorting all the daily returns from worst to best. The VaR is the return at the specific point where $(1-\alpha)$% of the returns are worse.

$$
\text{VaR}_\alpha = Q_\alpha(\{r_t\}_{t=1}')
$$

Where:

- $\{r_t\}_{t=1}'$ represents the set of historical returns, with $r_t$ being the return on day $t$, and $T$ being the total number of days.
- $Q_\alpha$ is the quantile function. It finds the value at the $\alpha$ percentile of the sorted historical returns.

**Expected Shortfall (ES):**

VaR tells you a "worst-case" loss, but it doesn't tell you *how bad* things could get if you *do* exceed the VaR. Expected Shortfall (ES) addresses this. ES is the average loss *given* that the loss is worse than the VaR. It is also known as the *Conditional Value at Risk*.

$$
\text{ES}_\alpha = \frac{1}{\lfloor T(1-\alpha) \rfloor} \sum_{r_t \leq \text{VaR}_\alpha} r_t
$$

Where:

- $\lfloor T(1-\alpha) \rfloor$ calculates the number of observations that fall below the VaR.
- The summation adds up all the historical returns ($r_t$) that are less than or equal to the calculated $\text{VaR}_\alpha$.
- We divide by the number of observations below the VaR to get the average loss in this "tail" of the distribution.

**Intuition:** If you're looking at a 95% VaR, ES tells you the average loss you'd expect on the worst 5% of days.

**Examples:** The portfolio analysis case study and the interactive application use this method, making it easy to see how it works in practice.

## Parametric Approach

Instead of relying solely on past data, the parametric approach assumes that returns follow a specific probability distribution, often the normal distribution (the bell curve). This is like saying, "Let's assume returns behave in a mathematically predictable way."

**Key Idea:** We use a mathematical formula (a probability distribution) to model the returns.

**Value at Risk (VaR):**

We need to find the point on the distribution where the area under the curve to the left of that point is equal to $1 - \alpha$. This point represents the VaR.

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\text{VaR}_\alpha} f_\theta(x)\ dx = 1- \alpha
$$

Where:

- $f_\theta(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the assumed distribution (e.g., the normal distribution). The PDF describes the relative likelihood of observing a particular return value.
- The integral calculates the area under the PDF curve from negative infinity up to the $\text{VaR}_\alpha$ value.
- $\theta$ represents the parameters that define the distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution).

This can be simplified using the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF):

$$
\text{VaR}_\alpha = F_\theta^{-1}(1-\alpha)
$$

Where:

- $F_\theta(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to $x$.
- $F_\theta^{-1}$ is the inverse of the CDF, also known as the quantile function.

**Expected Shortfall (ES):**

Similar to the historical simulation, ES is the average loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR. However, we now calculate this using the assumed probability distribution.

$$
\text{ES}_\alpha = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \int_{\text{VaR}_\alpha}^\infty x f_\theta(x)\ dx
$$

Where:

- The integral now calculates the average value of $x$ (the return) in the tail of the distribution, beyond the $\text{VaR}_\alpha$.
- We scale by $\frac{1}{1-\alpha}$

**Special Case: Normal Distribution**

If we assume returns are normally distributed (a common, but not always accurate, assumption), the ES calculation simplifies:

$$
\text{ES}_\alpha = \mu - \sigma \frac{\phi(\Phi^{-1}(\alpha))}{\alpha}
$$

Where:

- $\mu$ is the mean (average) return.
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of returns (a measure of volatility).
- $\phi$ is the standard normal probability density function (PDF).
- $\Phi^{-1}$ is the standard normal quantile function (the inverse of the standard normal CDF).

**Intuition:** The parametric approach provides a smooth, mathematically defined picture of risk. It's convenient, but its accuracy depends entirely on how well the chosen distribution matches reality.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is like creating a "virtual future" many times over. We use a computer to generate thousands of possible scenarios for future returns, based on a chosen statistical model.

**Key Idea:** Instead of relying on historical data or a single distribution, we simulate many possible future paths that preserve the correlation structure between assets in our portfolio.

**Workflow:**

1. **Calculate Covariance Matrix:** Estimate the covariance matrix ($\Sigma$) from historical returns to capture the relationships between different assets.

2. **Decompose the Covariance Matrix:** Use eigenvalue decomposition to break down the covariance matrix:
   $$\Sigma = VDV'$$
   Where:
   - $V$ is the matrix of eigenvectors
   - $D$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues
   - $V'$ is the transpose of $V$
   
   The eigenvectors ($V$) can be interpreted as new orthogonal "axes" (principal components) where the data becomes uncorrelated. The eigenvalues ($D$) represent the variance along these new axes.

3. **Create Transformation Matrix:** Construct a transformation matrix that can convert uncorrelated random variables into correlated ones:
   $$T = \sqrt{D}V'$$
   Where $\sqrt{D}$ is the diagonal matrix containing the square roots of the eigenvalues. This term scales the eigenvectors by the standard deviation (since the eigenvalues can be thought of as the variances). The resulting matrix $T$ "encodes" the covariance structure of the original data. When applied to uncorrelated random variables, it induces the desired correlation structure.

4. **Generate Random Samples:** Create a matrix of independent standard normal random variables $Z$ of size $n \times k$ where $k$ is the number of stocks in your original portfolio. The rows $n$ can be chosen freely.

5. **Transform to Correlated Returns:** Multiply the random samples by the transformation matrix to get correlated returns:
   $$\tilde{R} = ZA$$

6. **Calculate Portfolio Returns:** Compute the simulated portfolio returns using portfolio weights $w$:
   $$\tilde{r}_p = \tilde{R}w$$

7. **Calculate Risk Metrics:** Estimate VaR and ES from the distribution of simulated portfolio returns.

**Value at Risk (VaR):**

$$
\text{VaR}_\alpha = Q_\alpha(\{\tilde{r}_{p,i}\}_{i=1}^N)
$$

Where $\{\tilde{r}_{p,i}\}_{i=1}^N$ is the set of simulated portfolio returns, and $Q_\alpha$ represents the $\alpha$-quantile.

**Expected Shortfall (ES):**

$$
\text{ES}_\alpha = \mathbb{E}[\tilde{r}_p | \tilde{r}_p \leq \text{VaR}_\alpha]
$$

**Intuition:** The transformation approach ensures that our simulated returns maintain the same correlation structure as our historical data. This is crucial because portfolio risk isn't just about the volatility of individual assets, but how they move together.

This Monte Carlo method creates virtual scenarios that respect how assets interact with each other in real markets. By using eigenvalue decomposition, we're essentially capturing the fundamental "risk factors" driving our portfolio's behavior, then simulating how these factors might evolve in the future.
